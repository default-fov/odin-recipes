    <h2>How I really feel about pico de gallo</h2>
    <p>Pico de gallo is the perfect example of how raw ingredients can come together to create something magical. Fresh tomatoes, crunchy onions, fragrant cilantro, and a burst of lime juice come together in a simple, yet incredibly satisfying combination. The tomatoes bring a juicy sweetness, while the onions add a bite, and the cilantro adds a fresh pop that’s rounded out by the tang of lime. It’s fresh, bright, and vibrant—nothing too complicated, but everything you need.</p>
    <p>But here’s the magic: the balance of flavors goes deeper with each bite. The sweetness of the tomato plays off the sharpness of the onion, and the cilantro adds a subtle earthiness that keeps things interesting. A little kick from jalapeños sneaks up on you, transforming the dish into something bold and exciting. Pico de gallo isn’t just a topping—it’s a flavor experience that elevates any meal with its freshness, its spice, and its satisfying crunch.</p>
